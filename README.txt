1. DO NOT DELETE ANY PARAMETERS IN CONFIGURATION FILE, IF STUFF IS IN QUOTATION MARKS OR PARANTHESIS, LEAVE THEM THERE
2. ENSURE THE CONFIGURATION FILE IS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS DETECTION AND TRAINING FILES 
3. RUN TRAINING FILE BEFORE FEATURE DETECTION FILE 
4. IF YOU DELETE THE DESCRIPTOR_LIST.PB FILE, YOU WILL NEED TO RETRAIN YOUR MODEL
5. YOU CAN CHANGE THE PATHS OF THE FILES AS YOU PLEASE, BUT ENSURE YOU UPDATE IT IN THE CONFIGURATION FILES
6. IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE DOING, LEAVE THE CONFIGURATION FILE ALONE
